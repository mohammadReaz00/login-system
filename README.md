# PHP Login System

# What is Login 
A login is a set of credentials used to authenticate a user. Most often, these consist of a 
username and password. However, a login may include other information, such as a PIN 
number, passcode, or passphrase. Some logins require a biometric identifier, such as a 
fingerprint or retina scan. 

Logins are used by websites, computer applications, and mobile apps. They are a security 
measure designed to prevent unauthorized access to confidential data. When a login fails 
(i.e, the username and password combination does not match a user account), the user is 
disallowed access. Many systems block users from even trying to log in after multiple failed 
login attempts. 

# How it works
